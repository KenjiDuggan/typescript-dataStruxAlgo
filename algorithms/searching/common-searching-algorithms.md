## Search algorithms

### Linear Search 
 - Simply iterates through the items and until the value wanted is found, then returns the index

### Binary Search
- Data has to be SORTED
- Chooses the element in the middle of the array and compares it against the search value
- If element is equal to the value, we're done
- If element is greater than the value, search the left half of the array
- If element is less than the value, search the right half of the array
