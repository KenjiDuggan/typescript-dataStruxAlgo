## Trees

### Description
- Hierarchical data structure
- Every item in the tree is a node
- The node at the top of the tree is the root
- Every non-root node has one and only one parent
- A leaf node has no children
- A singleton tree has onle one node - the root
- No children node = Leaf
- Links are called Edges

### Binary Tree
- Every node has 0, 1, 2 children
- Children are referred to as left child and right child
- In practice, we use binary search trees

### Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Can perform insertions, deleteions, and retrievals in O(logN) time
- Left child always has a smaller value than parent
- Right child always has a larger value than parent
- Binary search can be performed
